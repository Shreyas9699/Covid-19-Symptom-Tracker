Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). It was first identified in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, and has since spread globally, resulting in an ongoing pandemic. Common symptoms include fever, cough, fatigue, shortness of breath, and loss of smell and taste.While the majority of cases result in mild symptoms, some progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), multi-organ failure, septic shock, and blood clots. The time from exposure to onset of symptoms is typically around five days but may range from two to fourteen days. As the coronavirus disease continues to evolve, a medium is necessary to spread awareness among people. The outbreak has also left many people feeling worried, isolated, lonely and stressed. More than ever, we all need to raise awareness, build solidarity, support each other, and be kind. Hence this project proposes an application that helps individuals track his/her health on a regular basis and helps them be more safe and can help them take necessary actions when required.

The main idea behind this project is to reduce the panic and mis concepts that people have regarding the COVID-19 virus. To meet this need, we developed an app Covid Symptom tracker. This app lets the user know if he/she is likely infected by a virus and if infected or not what precautions or cautions can be taken respectively. Helps reduce panic and myths on COVID-19.

The main objective behind building this project is to give every user a clear view of 
-> What are main symptoms of COVID-19 are
-> How safe they are, what precautions they can take
-> If they are likely to be infected then what shall they do next 
-> Help then understand actual facts on COVID-19 and be cautious
