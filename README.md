Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). It was first identified in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, and has since spread globally, resulting in an ongoing pandemic. Common symptoms include fever, cough, fatigue, shortness of breath, and loss of smell and taste.While the majority of cases result in mild symptoms, some progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), multi-organ failure, septic shock, and blood clots. The time from exposure to onset of symptoms is typically around five days but may range from two to fourteen days. As the coronavirus disease continues to evolve, a medium is necessary to spread awareness among people. The outbreak has also left many people feeling worried, isolated, lonely and stressed. More than ever, we all need to raise awareness, build solidarity, support each other, and be kind. Hence this project proposes an application that helps individuals track his/her health on a regular basis and helps them be more safe and can help them take necessary actions when required.

The main idea behind this project is to reduce the panic and mis concepts that people have regarding the COVID-19 virus. To meet this need, we developed an app Covid Symptom tracker. This app lets the user know if he/she is likely infected by a virus and if infected or not what precautions or cautions can be taken respectively. Helps reduce panic and myths on COVID-19.

Objective -> 
The main objective behind building this project is to give every user a clear view of,
-> What are main symptoms of COVID-19 are -> How safe they are, what precautions they can take
-> If they are likely to be infected then what shall they do next
-> Help then understand actual facts on COVID-19 and be cautious.

COVID-19 is an acute respiratory illness caused by the novel coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus.Although many people have presented with flu-like symptoms, widespread population testing is not yet available in most countries.

Thus, it is important to identify the combination of symptoms most predictive of COVID-19, to help guide recommendations for self-isolation and prevent further spread of the disease.

Some of the key symptoms which could be seen in most of the COVID infected persons are:
-> Fever
-> Dry Cough
-> Sore throat 
-> Immediate loss of smell or taste
-> Difficulty in breathing 
-> Chest pain or pressure
-> Loss of speech or movement, and more.

A free monitoring app 'COVID-19 Symptom Tracker' has been developed to record and monitor the symptoms of the COVID-19 coronavirus infection, tracking in real time how the disease progresses in an individual over a period of time.

We have used the most common symptoms and also the ones that are being presented by the WHO. We use a simple formula based checker where in the symptoms are being classified and prioritised, the weights are being assigned to them accordingly and the confidence score is calculated. Based on the confidence score we categorically divide the result into three groups:
1. High risk zone
The ones that are being diagnosed with this category are instructed to undergo COVID tests and are advised not to interact with others. They are strongly advised to stay isolated.
 
2. Low risk zone
The ones that are being diagnosed with this category need to be more cautious and take more precautions and are advised to consult a doctor if necessary.
 3. Safe zone
These people are considered to be safe and are free from the virus for now and are advised to stay the same and not travel anywhere unnecessarily.

Design
We have used Flutter and some other open source software to build our app. The main feature of our app are,
-> COVID-19 Symptoms Tracking
-> COVID-19 Risk Analysis Map
-> COVID-19 Fact Checker
-> COVID-19 Centers Informatics 
-> COVID-19 Preventive Measures
